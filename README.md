Describtion:
This project analyzes LinkedIn job postings to uncover trends in job titles, required skills, industries, and locations. Using NLP and data analytics, we explore patterns, classify job categories, and visualize emerging skill demands to better understand the job market.



Motivation:
Nowadays, many people are confused about which skills they need to acquire to get jobs they aspire to due to the rapid evolution of technologies and industries. New tools , programming languages ,  business practices and many other innovations are introduced regularly making the decision of which skills are really needed to acquire even more difficult.
